# IKEA Place (remake)  
A pratice project of remakeing IKEA Place iOS app.  
  
The UI layout is design for iPad in landscape mode.  
Basically using Unity and ARKit plugin v2 (v1 and v1.5 should also work fine) to develope the App.  
Also using Unity AssetBundle system and GCP with simple PHP api to create the model database and network system.  
(ps. the PHP files are not included right now.)
